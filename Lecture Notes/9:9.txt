function TREESEARCH(problem, strategy) returns a solution, or failure
	initialize the search tree using the initial state of the problem
	loop:
		if there are no candidates for expansion then return failure
		choose a leaf node for expansion based on strategy
		if the node contains a goal state then return the solution
		else expand the node, add the resulting nodes to the search tree
